## Frontend Developer Case

### `How to run`

    git clone https://github.com/foxxxyproxy/rick-and-morty-universe.git
    cd rick-and-morty-universe
    yarn install
    yarn start

It runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser <br>

Deployed prototype:[https://rick-and-morty-universe.vercel.app/]

### TODO and thoughts
There is still a big room for improvement like adding tests, split components into smaller ones. <br>
I'd like to add a pagination or something like that for showing big responses and make the image-grid more beautiful <br>


I wanted to give the user an opportunity to see all possible values of locations/episodes/dimensions.<br>
I think it's more comfortable for users, then input text :) <br>
<br>
Due to there wasn't any opportunity (in API) to get all possible values of it at one time, I did a loop to get all data from all pages. <br>
But I understand that for real projects it's not an efficient, way to make a filtration.<br>
